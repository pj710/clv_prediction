# Problem Statement: Modeling Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in Retail Data

## Background:
In today's competitive retail environment, understanding and predicting the lifetime value of a customer is crucial for targeting marketing efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing customer relationship management. The ability to estimate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) empowers businesses to identify their most valuable customers and tailor strategies accordingly to maximize profitability over the customer's entire relationship with the company.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a model that accurately calculates and predicts the Customer Lifetime Value for individuals within our retail dataset. By leveraging transactional data, including ['InvoiceNo', 'StockCode', 'Description', 'Quantity', 'InvoiceDate', 'UnitPrice', 'CustomerID', 'Country'], our goal is to quantify the total value a customer brings to the business throughout their relationship. This model will enable targeted marketing strategies, optimize customer acquisition costs, and identify opportunities for enhancing customer retention and loyalty.

## Data Overview:
The dataset comprises transaction records from a retail business, featuring the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Invoice number. A unique identifier for each transaction.
StockCode: Product (item) code.
Description: Product (item) description.
Quantity: The quantities of each product per transaction.
InvoiceDate: The day and time when each transaction was generated.
UnitPrice: Product price per unit.
CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Country: The name of the country where the customer resides.

## Methodology:
Data Pre-processing: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, erroneous data, and prepare the dataset for analysis. This step includes ensuring the correctness of data types and considering the incorporation of relevant time frames for CLV calculation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand patterns, anomalies, trends, and relationships within the data, focusing on customer purchase behavior and transactional metrics.

Feature Engineering: Develop new features that could be significant predictors of CLV, such as total spending per customer, average transaction value, purchase frequency, and customer tenure.

Revenue Prediction Model: Create regression models to predict the revenue from each customer. This step may involve splitting the data into training and testing sets to ensure model accuracy and generalizability.

Customer Lifetime Value Calculation: Utilize the predictive model along with a predefined formula for CLV calculation that factors in discount rates and customer lifespan to estimate the CLV for each customer.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance through suitable metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-Squared. Adjusting and refining the model as necessary based on evaluation outcomes.

Insights and Strategy Development: Analyze the results to derive actionable insights into customer behavior and value. Develop targeted marketing and customer relationship strategies based on the quantified CLV.

## Expected Outcomes:
A robust model that can predict Customer Lifetime Value based on transactional and customer data.
Insights into key drivers of CLV within the dataset, enabling the prioritization of strategies for customer retention and acquisition.
Enhanced understanding of customer segments, contributing to more effective and personalized marketing efforts.
By accurately modeling and predicting Customer Lifetime Value, the business can make informed decisions to foster long-term relationships with its customers, enhancing overall profitability and sustainability.
